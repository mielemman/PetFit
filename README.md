# PetFit: A Virtual Pet and Fitness Tracking Application

## Project Description

**PetFit** is an interactive Java-based console application designed to motivate and engage users in maintaining a healthy lifestyle by combining fitness tracking with virtual pet care. The application provides an immersive experience where users can complete workouts, take care of virtual pets, and track their progress in real time.

The core concept behind **PetFit** is simple: users set fitness goals and complete workouts to earn coins, which can be used to purchase and care for virtual pets. The more consistent the user is in their workouts, the more progress they make, earning rewards and unlocking new pets. Each pet in the game requires food, playtime, and attention, creating an engaging way to encourage daily activity. Additionally, **PetFit** provides motivational tips, habit tracking, and a leaderboard system to further incentivize users.

This application is designed for users of all ages who are looking for an enjoyable way to stay active while also caring for virtual pets. Whether youâ€™re a fitness enthusiast looking for motivation or someone who enjoys virtual pet games, **PetFit** combines both in a way that makes fitness fun and rewarding.

### Features:

- **Fitness Tracking**: Users can set and track their workout goals, marking progress with detailed reports and habit tracking.
- **Virtual Pet Care**: Users can adopt and care for a variety of pets, each with its own unique needs and benefits.
- **Coins and Rewards System**: Completing workouts earns coins, which can be used to feed and play with pets, unlocking new activities and rewards.
- **Progress Reports**: View cumulative statistics on workouts, pet care, and milestones.
- **Motivational Tips**: Receive daily encouragement to stay on track with your fitness goals.

### Technology Stack:

- **Java**: The primary programming language used to implement the core functionality of the application.

## II. Explanation of how OOP principles were applied

The **PetFit** application is built with core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, ensuring the system is modular, scalable, and maintainable. OOP focuses on organizing software design around objects, which can be defined by their attributes and behaviors. The main OOP principles applied in the **PetFit** application include:

### 1. **Encapsulation**:
Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on that data within a single unit or class. In **PetFit**, this is evident in how both Pet and User objects encapsulate their respective states and behaviors.

- The Pet class holds attributes like name, hunger, happiness, and health. Each pet also has methods such as feed(), play(), and petAction() to change their state (e.g., updating hunger levels or happiness).

- The User class encapsulates the user's information such as username, password, fitnessLevel, and coins. It includes methods that allow interaction with the user's pets, workouts, and goals.
  
This encapsulation keeps the internal state of objects private and only accessible through well-defined public methods, making the code more secure and easier to manage.

### 2. **Abstraction**:
Abstraction simplifies complex systems by providing a high-level interface while hiding unnecessary details. In **PetFit**, this is applied through the use of base classes and overriding methods in subclasses.

- The Pet class acts as an abstract concept for all pets. While the Pet class defines common attributes and actions (like feeding or playing), it does not specify the exact behavior for different types of pets (e.g., how a **Bear** or a **Dog** plays). This level of abstraction ensures that the application can define behaviors for different pets without modifying the base structure.
  
- Each specific pet class (e.g., Bear, Dog, Dragon) overrides methods like feed(), play(), and petAction() to provide unique implementations specific to the pet type. For example, the Dog class might print a message like "is running around and playing fetch!" whereas the Bear class might say "is roaring and hunting in the forest!".

This abstraction allows for a clean, maintainable codebase where new types of pets can be added easily without altering existing code.

### 3. **Inheritance**:
Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and behaviors from another class (superclass). This promotes reusability and modularity in the application. In **PetFit**, inheritance is used extensively:

- The Pet class is the superclass that provides common properties and methods shared by all pet types. It defines general attributes like hunger, happiness, health, and methods such as feed(), play(), and petAction(). 
- Specific pet classes like Bear, Dog, Dragon, Pig, and Rabbit inherit from the Pet class. Each subclass provides its own implementation for the methods like feed() and play(), making them unique to each pet type.

This inheritance structure allows the application to maintain a clean and hierarchical organization, ensuring that common functionality is defined once in the Pet class and then extended by individual pet types.

#### Example: The **Bear** class
java

public class Bear extends Pet {
    public Bear(String name) {
        super(name, "Bear ASCII Art");
        this.hunger = 50;
        this.happiness = 50;
        this.health = 100;
    }

    @Override
    public void feed() {
        this.hunger = 100; // Full after feeding
        System.out.println(name + " has been fed and is now full.");
    }

    @Override
    public void play() {
        this.happiness = 100; // Happy after play
        System.out.println(name + " is roaring and hunting in the forest!");
    }

    @Override
    public void petAction() {
        System.out.println(name + " is resting and enjoying the peace.");
    }
}
